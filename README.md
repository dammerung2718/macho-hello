# Mach-O Hello

This is my attempt at trying to understand Mach-O file format.
`gen.c` includes a file that generates a linkable Mach-O object file.
It is a "Hello World" program.

```sh
make    # generates `./hello`
./hello # prints "Hello, World!" and halts
```

I can confidently say that I understand the Mach-O file format now.
But damn it is low-key hard to work with.
